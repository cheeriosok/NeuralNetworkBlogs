# 🔍 SRCNN From Scratch: ML Systems Optimization with CUDA

Welcome to a hands-on ML Systems Engineering journey — where we take a Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) from a bare-bones MVP to a fully optimized CUDA-powered inference engine.

> **Goal:** This project is not just about building a neural network. It’s about engineering an optimized system — with CUDA kernels, memory hierarchies, and benchmark-driven insights.

## ⚙️ Series Overview

This is an 8-part blog series focused on building and optimizing an SRCNN from the ground up, with code, profiling, and GPU performance as the guiding principles. Each part ships working code and measurable improvements.
